                A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable bank account. The
                donor puts money in, takes the full deduction, and decides later
                where it goes, similar to a foundation but without the 5 percent
                minimum. The balance can sit invested in the market, and larger
                accounts can even hold private equity, venture capital, hedge
                funds, and real estate stakes, growing tax-free until the money
                is granted out.

              <p>
                In this way, foundations and donor-advised funds are not
                destinations, but intermediaries. Money enters them, sits, and
                leaves on the schedule a donor or board controls.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                For the above table, Giving USA reported $117.15 billion
                foundations granted out to nonprofits, not the $79.05 billion
                that they received. That distinction matters, because
                contributions to foundations fell 16.2 percent in 2025, with
                foundations granting out $38.1 billion more than they took in.

              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Donor-advised funds are counted the other way. The deduction
                happens the year the money enters the account, not the year it
                eventually reaches a nonprofit. Once deposited, nothing requires
                the money to move: There is no minimum, no deadline, and no
                account-level reporting. For example, in 2024, $90.57 billion
                entered DAF accounts while $64.60 billion was granted out of
                them, a difference of roughly $26 billion counted as given but
                not yet delivered.<Cite>5</Cite> Measured the way foundations
                are, by what left rather than what arrived, total philanthropic
                donations would be roughly 4 percent smaller.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Now, although nothing compels this money to move, it moves
                anyway. DAF accounts held $327.87 billion across 3.59 million
                accounts by the end of 2024, and granted out 25.2 percent of
                what they started with, compared to foundations operating under
                a legal floor, which granted roughly 7 percent.<Cite>4,5</Cite>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                A possible explanation for this difference is not discipline but
                lifespan: A foundation is built to exist in perpetuity, and the
                5 percent is calibrated to preserve the principal, which makes
                it a spending limit as much as a spending requirement. A DAF has
                no institution to sustain and no obligation to exist in 50
                years, so it prioritizes the present.

                The retreat was not only foreign. In the first 4 to 6 months of
                2025, a third of American nonprofits reported at least one
                government funding disruption. 21 percent lost at least some
                government funding, 27 percent had funding delayed, paused, or
                frozen, and 6 percent received a full stop work order.

                percent. Hiring plans fell from 52 to 38 percent by mid-2025,
                and the share of nonprofits planning layoffs more than doubled.

              <p>
                The burden of proof required to reach philanthropic dollars
                keeps rising. Effective altruism pushed cost-per-outcome
                reasoning into mainstream giving. To standardize metrics, the
                Global Impact Investing Network built a global catalog, giving
                funders a common vocabulary for comparing performance across
                organizations.<Cite>16</Cite> A whole industry was born to help
                nonprofits demonstrate return on impact, because funders
                increasingly expect it before committing.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                But that proof depends on public data, and that public data is
                contracting. All 13 principal federal statistical agencies lost
                staff beginning in early 2025. 6 of them lost at least a third
                of their workforce and 2 more than two thirds, which the
                American Statistical Association ties directly to halted
                reports, falling response rates, and reduced data production.
                <Cite>17</Cite> For example, the Department of Agriculture
                defunded the annual household food security survey entirely.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Every funding source in this paper moves on trust. A foundation
                or company funds organizations its staff already know (71
                percent of private foundations tell the IRS they fund only
                preselected organizations), and the ones with open applications
                ask for years of financial proof a new organization can&apos;t
                have.<Cite>19</Cite> A donor-advised fund grants to causes its
                donor has already chosen. A bequest is written years before it
                arrives. Trust takes time, and startups have none.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The incentives that push the for-profit sector to find new
                startups (commissions, returns, and equity) also don&apos;t
                exist for nonprofits. The youngest founders are the ones where
                the gap is easiest to see, but nobody is paid to look.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We looked, because we are that generation, and found the ones
                who started anyway. In 2014, the IRS introduced Form 1023-EZ,
                replacing its 26-page application with a short form, approving
                new nonprofits in weeks, not months.<Cite>20</Cite> Social media
                put the world&apos;s problems in front of teenagers, and free
                tools let them register an organization, build an audience, and
                run programs online before anyone cuts them a check.

              <p className="mt-4">
                From the outside, it looks like the money followed. Young
                founders win awards, land press, and share impact reports that
                read like success. Yet less than 0.002 percent of philanthropic
                dollars reach early-stage, under-35-led initiatives (applied to
                Giving USA&apos;s 2025 total, that is $12.3 million against
                $617.2 billion).<Cite>2,21</Cite>

                The TRIIBE 100, our global index of the 100 leading nonprofit
                founders under 30, measures what each organization discloses
                publicly. The 75 confirmed so far carry 512 years of nonprofit
                leadership and have raised $8.6 million. On average, they have
                run their organizations for 7 years and raised $115,000.
                Measured differently than RIVET&apos;s broader estimate, the
                conclusion is the same: Even the best of the nonprofit startup
                sector are underfunded.

              <p className="mt-4">
                The common belief is that teenagers start nonprofits to get into
                college. The reality is these founders turn 18, look for a way
                to fund the work with a salary, and find out there isn&apos;t
                one. Many keep the organization running through 4 years of
                college anyway, waiting for a door that, until now, nobody had
                built.

                What Comes Next
              </h2>
              <p>
                The nonprofit sector has never stopped inventing. England wrote
                the first legal definition of charity in 1601,<Cite>22</Cite>{" "}
                and every innovation since has been built on it: The first
                foundation in 1867,<Cite>23</Cite> the U.S. charitable deduction
                in 1917,<Cite>24</Cite> the first donor-advised fund in 1931,
                <Cite>25</Cite> impact investing in 1969,<Cite>26</Cite> and
                crowdfunding in 2010.<Cite>27</Cite> Every one of them made it
                easier to give. None of them rewarded anyone for looking.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The next innovation has to work the other way. In 2025 the money
                was there. The connection to founders was not. The for-profit
                world solves this with portfolios: Back many, expect most to
                fail, measure the return on investment on the whole.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The nonprofit sector should do the same: Back many, expect some
                to fail, measure the social return on investment on the whole.
                Not because established organizations can&apos;t innovate, but
                because they can&apos;t afford to. An organization with staff,
                programs, and donors to protect cannot bet on an idea that might
                not work. A founder with nothing yet to protect can, which is
                why every sector that innovates has a startup engine, and why
                the nonprofit sector needs its own.
              </p>

              <p className="my-8 font-bold text-zinc-950 leading-relaxed">
                So we built TRIIBE, maximizing return on impact and income for
                philentrepreneurs. We back the TRIIBE 100 with funding,
                mentorship, and measurement of their social return on
                investment. TRIIBE Talks give visibility: Intergenerational
                conversations featuring next-gen voices. TRIIBE Grants gives the
                rest of the sector the largest grant database in the world, free
                for anyone to search.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4 font-normal text-zinc-700">
                Whether these philentrepreneurs succeed with innovations the
                sector hasn&apos;t imagined yet, become the bench of future
                executive directors, or fail, the sector will finally have a way
                to try.
